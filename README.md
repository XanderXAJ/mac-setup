mac-setup
======

mac-setup is a script to set up an macOS laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

The script is a modified version of the [Laptop](https://github.com/thoughbot/Laptop)
project by [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com).

Requirements
------------

We support:
* macOS Sierra (10.12)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rightmove/mac-setup/master/setup
./setup 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rightmove/mac-setup/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

What it sets up
---------------

macOS tools:

* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries.

[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh/

Unix tools:
* [Git] for version control
* [OpenSSL] for Transport Layer Security (TLS)

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/
[OpenSSL]: https://www.openssl.org/

TODO need to put links to the rest of the dependencies

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `setup` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.
